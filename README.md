The Scheduler Application is envisioned as a user-friendly app where individuals can seamlessly schedule, view, modify, and delete meetings. The app would cater to professionals, students, and anyone who juggles multiple meetings daily. By combining an intuitive design with essential features, the app aims to address common scheduling pain points, such as conflicts, missed updates, or forgotten meeting details.
